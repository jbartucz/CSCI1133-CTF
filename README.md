# Welcome to the CSCI1133 Capture The Flag!! (CTF)

The csci1133.py program must be run in a folder called CSCI1133-CTF or it won't work.

In order to progress, you must run the program csci1133.py

It will automatically create the subdirectories and files for you as you go through the challenges.

The "Flags" are 6-digit integers hidden somewhere inside the subfolder. When you find the flag, you should run the csci1133.py program again and enter the code. It will tell you if you found a valid flag, and if you did, it will hide the next one for you.

REMEMBER: the csci1133.py program must be run in the folder called CSCI1133-CTF or it won't work.
