# Welcome to the CSCI1133 Capture The Flag!! (CTF)

The csci1133.py program must be run in a folder called CSCI1133-CTF or it won't work.

In order to progress, you must run the program csci1133.py

It will automatically create the subdirectories and files for you as you go through the challenges.

The first few "flags" you need to find are six-digit integers hidden inside a text file. For example, the first flag is inside a text file flag01.txt inside the subfolder flag01 - all you need to do is change into that folder and look inside the file.

The later text files might have a code or they might just have instructions or hints on how to find the flag. When you find the flag, you should run the csci1133.py program again and enter the code. It will tell you if you found a valid flag, and if you did, it will hide the next one for you.

REMEMBER: the csci1133.py program must be run in the base folder called CSCI1133-CTF or it won't work.
